<H3>STEAM&reg; SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT</H3><br>
<p>This Steam Subscriber Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations as a Subscriber. Please read it carefully.</p>
<p>1. REGISTRATION AND ACTIVATION.</p>
<p>Steam is an online service (&quot;Steam&quot;) offered by Valve Corporation (&quot;Valve&quot;).</p>
<p>You become a subscriber of Steam (&quot;Subscriber&quot;) by installing the Steam client software and completing the Steam registration. Additionally, as a Subscriber you may obtain access to certain services, software and content (&quot;Subscriptions&quot;) available to Subscribers. Conclusion of this contract between Valve and you takes place as soon as you access the Steam service after accepting this Agreement.</p>
<p>Unless you are a Licensed Cybercafe Operator (as defined below), this Agreement does not allow you to exploit the Software or any of its parts for any commercial purpose including, but not limited to, use at a Cybercafe, computer gaming center or any other location-based site. A &quot;Cybercafe&quot; is a physical establishment in which computer stations are made available for use by customers. A &quot;Licensed Cybercafe Operator&quot; is a Cybercafe that has agreed to the Subscription Terms for Licensed Cybercafe Operators posted at <a target="_new" href="http://store.steampowered.com/cybercafe_agreement/">http://store.steampowered.com/cybercafe_agreement/</a>.</p>
<p>Each Subscription allows you access to certain services, software and other content under the terms of each such Subscription and this Agreement. Additional terms provided with each such Subscription (&quot;Subscription Terms&quot;) may apply to the use of a given Subscription, and are incorporated into this Agreement. Further, additional terms (for example, fees and billing procedures) may be posted on <a target="_new" href="http://www.steampowered.com">http://www.steampowered.com</a> or within the Steam service (&quot;Rules of Use&quot;), and are incorporated into this Agreement. As a Subscriber, you agree to all of the terms and conditions of the Valve Privacy Policy, which are also incorporated into this Agreement. A copy of the Valve Privacy Policy can be found at <a target="_new" href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm">http://www.valvesoftware.com/privacy.htm</a>.</p>
<p>When you complete Steam's registration process, you create a Steam account (&quot;Account&quot;). Your Account may also include billing information you provide to us for the purchase of Subscriptions. You are solely responsible for all activity on your Account and for the security of your computer system. You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account. You agree that you are personally responsible for the use of your password and Account and for all of the communication and activity on Steam that results from use of your login name and password. You may not sell or charge others for the right to use your Account, or otherwise transfer your Account.</p>
<p>2. LICENSES</p>

<p>Steam and your Subscription(s) require the automatic download and installation of software and other content and updates onto your computer (&quot;Software&quot;). You may not use the Software for any purpose other than the permitted access to Steam and your Subscriptions. You understand that for reasons that include, without limitation, system security, stability, and multiplayer interoperability, Steam may need to automatically update, pre-load, create new versions or otherwise enhance the Software and accordingly, the system requirements to use the Software may change over time. You understand that neither this Agreement nor the terms associated with a particular Subscription entitles you to future updates, new versions or other enhancements of the Software associated with a particular Subscription although Valve may choose to provide such updates, etc. in its sole discretion.</p>

  (iv) you must include any Valve license agreement provided with the Steam Installer; and<br>
  (v) you must preserve in all copies of the Steam Installer all copyright and legal notices that are attached to the copy of the Steam Installer received by you.</p>
<p>B. Beta Software Terms</p>
<p>Valve may from time to time make software accessible to you via Steam prior to the general commercial release of such software (&quot;Beta Software&quot;). You are not required to use Beta Software, but if Valve offers it, you may elect to use it under the following terms. Beta Software will be deemed to be Software, and each item of Beta Software provided will be deemed a Subscription for such Beta Software, with the following provisions specific to Beta Software:</p>
<p>(i) your right to use the Beta Software license is effective until the earlier of: (a) Valve ceases to make the Beta Software accessible to you; (b) Valve issues a final release of the software that corresponds to the Beta Software; or (c) termination by Valve pursuant to Section 13 below;<br>

  (iv) in addition to the waivers and limitations of liability for all Software under Section 9 below, you specifically acknowledge that Beta Software is not final and may create incompatibilities or damage to your computer, data, and/or software. If you decide to install and/or use Beta Software, it is entirely at your own risk.</p>
<p>C. Source SDK.</p>
<p>Your Subscription(s) may contain access to the Valve software development kit (the &quot;SDK&quot;) for the computer game engine used in Half-Life 2 and other compatible Valve products (the &quot;Source Engine&quot;). You may use, reproduce and modify the SDK on a non-commercial basis solely to develop a modified game (a &quot;Mod&quot;) for Half-Life 2 or other Valve products compatible with and using the Source Engine. You may reproduce and distribute the Mod in object code form, solely to licensed end users of Half-Life 2 or other compatible Valve products, provided that the Mod is made publicly available and distributed without charge on a non-commercial basis</p>
<p>If you would like to use the Source SDK or a Mod for a commercial purpose or activity, please contact Valve at sourceengine@valvesoftware.com.</p>
<p>D. Ownership.</p>
<p>All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Software and any and all copies thereof are owned by Valve and/or its licensors. All rights reserved, except as expressly stated herein. The Software is protected by the copyright laws of the United States, international copyright treaties and conventions and other laws. The Software contains certain licensed materials and Valve's licensors may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>E. Restrictions.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise permitted under Section 2(C) with regard to the SDK, you may not, in whole or in part, copy, photocopy, reproduce, translate, reverse engineer, derive source code, modify, disassemble, decompile, create derivative works based on, or remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Software or any software accessed via Steam without the prior consent, in writing, of Valve.</p>

<p>3. MERCHANDISE</p>
<p>A. General.</p>
<p>Valve may from time to time offer items other than software, content and services for purchase via Steam (e.g., apparel, books, posters, etc.) (&quot;Merchandise&quot;). Valve may offer Merchandise together with or separate from Subscriptions, but such Merchandise is incidental to Subscriptions and the predominant purpose of Steam is and shall remain the provision of Subscriptions and services related thereto. All offers to purchase Merchandise via Steam are made and accepted subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Your communications with Valve or submission of any purchase order or other similar forms containing provisions contrary to the terms of this Agreement or the terms presented by Valve during purchase of Merchandise via Steam are hereby rejected and are not binding on Valve.</p>
<p>B. Shipping &amp; Risk of Loss</p>
<p>This is a shipment contract. All Merchandise will be shipped FOB Blaine, Washington, unless Valve designates otherwise on Steam in connection with a particular order. If you are an international customer, you acknowledge that Merchandise will be shipped from the United States and that you are responsible for any applicable import duties, customs fees, and taxes. Valve's liability as to delivery ceases, and title and risk of loss for the Merchandise will pass upon Valve's delivery of the Merchandise to a transportation carrier at the designated shipping point. If you pick up the Merchandise from Valve's place of business, title to and risk of loss will pass to you when Merchandise is placed at your disposal.</p>
<p>C. Acceptance/Rejection/Returns</p>
<p>The terms of this Section 3.C do not apply to European Union consumers. You will have a period of thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of any Merchandise to examine the Merchandise to confirm that it conforms to this Agreement and the offer for such Merchandise presented to you at Steam. If the Merchandise does not conform to this Agreement and the offer for such Merchandise presented to you via Steam, you may reject the Merchandise by returning it to Valve (at your expense) along with a copy of the receipt or other proof of purchase. Additional policies and instructions for returning defective merchandise to Valve can be found at <a target="_new" href="http://storehelp.valvesoftware.com">http://storehelp.valvesoftware.com</a>. After Valve has received your valid return, Valve will, within a reasonable time and in Valve's sole discretion: repair the Merchandise, replace the Merchandise with an equivalent item, credit to the credit card used to pay for the product an amount equal to the value of the Merchandise (as determined by Valve in its reasonable discretion), or provide another remedy that Valve determines in good faith is appropriate in the circumstances. All claims whether based on contract, negligence, strict liability or otherwise are waived unless made in writing and received by Valve within thirty (30) days after your receipt of Merchandise.</p>
<p>4. BILLING, PAYMENT AND OTHER SUBSCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>Valve offers some Subscriptions for free, and some for a Subscription fee. All fees are stated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>A. Payment by Credit Card.</p>
<p>When you provide credit card information to Valve, you represent to Valve that you are the authorized user of the credit card and that you authorize Valve to charge your credit card for any Merchandise or Subscription, Steam Wallet funds, or other fees incurred by you. For recurring monthly Subscriptions, each month that you use such Subscription(s), you agree and reaffirm that Valve is authorized to charge your credit card (or your Steam Wallet, if funded) for the Subscription fee. You agree to notify Valve promptly of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, and you agree to notify Valve promptly if your credit card expires or is canceled for any reason.</p>
<p>B. Charges to Your Credit Card.</p>
<p>ALL STEAM FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. Valve reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time and Valve will provide notice of any such change at least thirty (30) days advance. All changes will be posted as amendments to this Agreement or in the Rules of Use (e.g. Steam release notices) and you are responsible for reviewing the billing section of Steam to obtain timely notice of such changes. Your non-cancellation of your Account or an affected Subscription thirty (30) days after posting of the changes on Steam means that you accept such changes. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your Account or a particular Subscription at any time as described below, but Valve will not refund any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your Account or Subscription, and Valve will not prorate fees for any cancellation. If your use of Steam is subject to any type of use or sales tax, then Valve may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the Subscription or other fees published in the Rules of Use. The European Union VAT ( &ldquo;VAT &rdquo;) tax amounts collected by Valve reflect VAT due on the value of any Software or Subscription as well as import VAT collected which is to be paid to the tax authorities for the importation of Merchandise.</p>
<p>As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends. Information on how to cancel your Account or a particular Subscription can be found at <a target="_new" href="http://www.steampowered.com/">http://www.steampowered.com/</a>. Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before you cancel your Account or a particular Subscription. In the event that your Account or a particular subscription is terminated or canceled, no refund, including any Subscription fees, will be granted. Any delinquent or unpaid Accounts must be settled before Valve will allow you to register again.</p>
<p>C. Steam Wallet. </p>
<p>ALL STEAM FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART. Steam may make available an account balance associated with your Account (the &ldquo;Steam Wallet&rdquo;). You may place funds in your Steam Wallet up to a maximum amount determined by Valve, by credit card, prepaid card, promotional code, or any other payment method accepted by Steam. You may use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Subscriptions or make transactions within Subscriptions, where Steam Wallet transactions are enabled. Funds added to the Steam Wallet are non-refundable and non-transferable. Steam Wallet funds have no value outside Steam and can only be used to purchase Subscriptions and related content via Steam (including but not limited to games offered on the Steam Store). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Steam Wallet funds that are deemed abandoned or unused by law will not be returned or restored. </p>
<p>When your account uses your Steam Wallet to fund a purchase, you authorize Valve to deduct the amount of the purchase from your Steam Wallet. If you do not have sufficient funds in your Steam Wallet to make a purchase and you have previously entered your credit card information, we may automatically charge your credit card a minimum amount determined by Valve to make the purchase, even if such minimum amount exceeds the cost of your purchase. Any difference between the minimum charge and the cost of the purchase will be credited to your Steam Wallet. </p>
<p>D. Retail Purchase.</p>
<p>Valve may offer or require a Subscription for purchasers of retail packaged product versions or OEM versions of Valve products. The &quot;CD-Key&quot; or &quot;Product Key&quot; accompanying such versions is used to activate your Subscription.</p>
<p>E. Steam Authorized Resellers.</p>
<p>You may purchase a Subscription through an authorized reseller of Valve. The &quot;Product Key&quot; accompanying such purchase will be used to activate your Subscription. If you purchase a Subscription from an authorized reseller of Valve, you agree to direct all questions regarding the Product Key to that reseller.</p>
<p>F. Free Subscriptions.</p>
<p>In some cases, Valve may offer a free Subscription to certain services, software and content. As with all Subscriptions, you are always responsible for any Internet service provider, telephone, and other connection fees that you may incur when using Steam, even when Valve offers a free Subscription.</p>
<p>G. Third Party Sites.</p>
<p>Steam may provide links to other third party sites. Some of these sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in and are in addition to any Subscription or other fees that you may pay to Valve. Steam may also provide access to third-party vendors, who provide content, goods and/or services on Steam or the Internet. Any separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility. Valve makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding any such third party site.</p>
<p>H. Pricing and Payment for Merchandise.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the following terms apply to pricing of and payment for Merchandise. The prices for Merchandise displayed on Steam are subject to change at any time without notice. Charges for shipping, handling and tax may not be included in displayed prices for Merchandise but will be displayed during the purchase process, although such displayed prices may not include all taxes, duties, and other fees that you may be obligated to pay to applicable government authorities. Shipping and handling charges displayed on Steam may or may not reflect the actual charges paid by Valve. All war-risk, marine, or other insurance; harbor charges; tolls; wharfage; demurrage; wharf handling; duties, or warehousing charges are excluded from Merchandise prices displayed on Steam and are your responsibility. You may be obligated under applicable local law to pay additional import duties and fees.</p>
<p>You must pay all applicable sales and use taxes, value added taxes and other taxes levied on you by any taxing authority on any Merchandise purchase in any country where such transactions are otherwise subject to tax, regardless of the method of delivery. Any taxes owed by you (i) as a result of purchasing Merchandise or the payment of any fee, (ii) that are required or permitted to be collected from you by Valve under applicable law, and (iii) that are based upon the amounts payable under this Agreement, must be remitted by you to Valve. Failure on Valve's part to invoice you for any such taxes does not relieve you of the liability to pay such taxes. You will promptly reimburse Valve for all taxes or other charges imposed upon Valve by any national, state or municipal government upon the sale, use, production, or transportation of Merchandise.</p>
<p>5. ONLINE CONDUCT, CHEATING AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR</p>
<p>You agree that you will be personally responsible for the use of your Account and for all of the communication and activity on Steam that results from use of your Account. Your online conduct and interaction with other subscribers should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette. Specific requirements may also be found in the Steam Online Conduct rules at <a target="_new" href="http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct">http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct</a>, other Rules of Use, the Subscription Terms, or in terms of use required by third parties who host particular games or other services.</p>
<p>Steam and the Software may include functionality designed to identify software or hardware processes or functionality that may give a player an unfair competitive advantage when playing multiplayer versions of any Software, other Valve products, or modifications thereof (&quot;Cheats&quot;). You agree that you will not create or assist third parties in any way to create Cheats. You agree that you will not directly or indirectly disable, circumvent, or otherwise interfere with the operation of software designed to prevent or report the use of Cheats. You acknowledge and agree that either Valve or any online multiplayer host may refuse to allow you to participate in certain online multiplayer games if you use Cheats in connection with Steam or the Software. Further, you acknowledge and agree that an online multiplayer host may report your use of Cheats to Valve, and Valve may communicate your history of use of Cheats to other online multiplayer hosts for Valve products. Valve may terminate your Account or a particular Subscription for any conduct or activity that Valve believes is illegal, constitutes a Cheat, or which otherwise negatively affects the enjoyment of Steam by other Subscribers. You acknowledge that Valve is not required to provide you notice before terminating your Subscriptions(s) and/or Account, but it may choose to do so.</p>
<p>6. THIRD PARTY CONTENT</p>
<p>In regard to all Subscriptions, Software, and related content that are not authored by Valve, Valve acts merely as an intermediary service provider. Valve does not screen such third party content available on Steam or through other sources. Valve does not assume any responsibility or liability for such third party content.</p>
<p>7. USER GENERATED INFORMATION</p>
<p>&quot;User Generated Information&quot; means any information made available to other users through your use of multi-user features of Steam or to Valve through your use of the Software. User Generated Information may include, but is not limited to, chat, forum posts, screen names, game selections, player performances, usage data, suggestions about Valve products or services, and error notifications. Subject to the Valve privacy policy referenced in Section 1 above, as applicable, you expressly grant Valve the complete and irrevocable right to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and perform the User Generated Information and derivative works thereof in any form, anywhere, with or without attribution to you, and without any notice or compensation to you of any kind.</p>
<p>8. DEDICATED SERVER</p>
<p>Your Subscription(s) may contain access to the Valve Dedicated Server software. You may use the Valve Dedicated Server software on an unlimited number of computers for the purpose of hosting online multiplayer games of Valve products. If you wish to operate the Valve Dedicated Server software, you will be solely responsible for procuring any Internet access, bandwidth, or hardware for such activities and will bear all costs associated therewith.</p>
<p>9. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; NO GUARANTEES</p>

<p>THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF STEAM, THE SOFTWARE, AND MERCHANDISE REMAINS WITH YOU, THE USER.

IN NO EVENT WILL VALVE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH STEAM, THE SOFTWARE, MERCHANDISE THAT YOU ACQUIRE VIA STEAM, ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, OR THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE MERCHANDISE OR ANY INFORMATION, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR BREACH OF VALVE'S WARRANTY AND EVEN IF VALVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
